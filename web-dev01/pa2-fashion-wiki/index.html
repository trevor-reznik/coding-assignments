        "Fashion in the 1990s was defined by a return to minimalist fashion, in
        contrast to the more elaborate and flashy trends of the 1980s. One
        notable shift was the mainstream adoption of tattoos, body piercings
        aside from ear piercing and to a much lesser extent, other forms of body
        modification such as branding.
        <br /><br />
        Due to increased availability of the Internet and satellite television
        outside the United States, plus the reduction of import tariffs under
        NAFTA, fashion became more globalized6 and homogeneous in the late 1990s
        and early 2000s.
        <br /><br />
        In the early 1990s, several late 1980s fashions remained very stylish
        among both sexes. However, the popularity of grunge and alternative rock
        music helped bring the simple, unkempt grunge look to the mainstream by
        1992" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_in_fashion"

        "The anti-conformist approach to fashion led to the popularization of
        the casual chic look that included T-shirts, jeans, hoodies, and
        sneakers, a trend which continued into the 2000s" (<a

        Additionally, fashion trends throughout the decade recycled styles from
        previous decades, notably the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
