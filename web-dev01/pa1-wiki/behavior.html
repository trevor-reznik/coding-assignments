        <h3>Roadrunner Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          "The roadrunner usually lives alone or in pairs. Breeding pairs are
          monogamous and mate for life, and pairs may hold a territory all year.
          During the courtship display, the male bows, alternately lifting and
          dropping his wings and spreading his tail. He parades in front of the
          female with his head high and his tail and wings drooped, and may
          bring an offering of food. The reproductive season is spring to
          mid-summer (depending on geographic location and species)." (<a

        </p>
        <h5>Nesting</h5>
        <p>
          "The roadrunner's nest is often composed of sticks, and may sometimes
          contain leaves, feathers, snakeskins, or dung. It is commonly placed 1
          to 3 meters (3 to 10 feet) above ground level in a low tree, bush, or
          cactus. Roadrunner eggs are generally white. The greater roadrunner
          generally lays 2â€“6 eggs per clutch, but the lesser roadrunner's
          clutches are typically smaller. Hatching is asynchronous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both sexes incubate the nest (with males incubating the nest at night)
          and feed the hatchlings. For the first one to two weeks after the
          young hatch, one parent remains at the nest. The young leave the nest
          at two to three weeks old, foraging with parents for a few days after.
        </p>
        <h5>Diet</h5>
        <p>
          The roadrunner is an opportunistic omnivore. Its diet normally
          consists of insects (such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, and
          beetles), small reptiles (such as lizards and snakes, including
          rattlesnakes),[14] rodents and other small mammals, spiders (including
          tarantulas), scorpions, centipedes, snails, small birds (and
          nestlings), eggs, and fruits and seeds like those from prickly pear
          cactuses and sumacs. The lesser roadrunner eats mainly insects. The
          roadrunner forages on the ground and, when hunting, usually runs after
          prey from under cover. It may leap to catch insects, and commonly
          batters certain prey against the ground. Because of its quickness, the
          roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon rattlesnakes;[15]
          it is also the only real predator of tarantula hawk wasps."
