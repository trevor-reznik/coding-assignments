        <h3>Roadrunner Thermoregulation</h3>
        <p>
          "During the cold desert night, the roadrunner lowers its body
          temperature slightly, going into a slight torpor to conserve energy.
          To warm itself during the day, the roadrunner exposes dark patches of
          skin on its back to the sun." (<a

        </p>
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <p>
          "The Hopi and other Pueblo tribes believed that roadrunners were
          medicine birds and could protect against evil spirits. Their unusual
          X-shaped footprints are used as sacred symbols to ward off evil in
          many Pueblo tribes—partially because they invoke the protective power
          of the roadrunners themselves, and partially because the X shape of
          the tracks conceals which direction the bird is headed (thus throwing
          malignant spirits off track.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Indigenous peoples of Central America have developed numerous beliefs
          about the roadrunner. The Ch’orti’, who call it t’unk’u’x or mu’, have
          taboos against harming the bird. The Ch'ol Maya believe roadrunners to
          have special powers. It is known to them as ajkumtz’u’, derived from
          the bird's call that is said to make the listener feel tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word for roadrunner in the Oʼodham language is taḏai, which is the
          name of a transit center in Tucson, Arizona."
