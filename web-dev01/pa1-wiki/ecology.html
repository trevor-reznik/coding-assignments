        <h3>Roadrunner Ecology</h3>
        <p>
          "The roadrunner usually lives alone or in pairs. Breeding pairs are
          monogamous and mate for life, and pairs may hold a territory all year.
          During the courtship display, the male bows, alternately lifting and
          dropping his wings and spreading his tail. He parades in front of the
          female with his head high and his tail and wings drooped, and may
          bring an offering of food. The reproductive season is spring to
          mid-summer (depending on geographic location and species)." (<a

        <h5>Brood Parasitism</h5>
        <p>
          "The attribute for which the cuckoos are best known is the habit of
          brood parasitism, found in all of the Cuculinae and three species of
          Phaenicophaeinae. It consists of laying the eggs singly in the nests
          of certain other bird species to be incubated by the foster parents,
          who rear the young cuckoo. Among the 47 species of cuculines, various
          adaptations enhance the survival of the young cuckoo: egg mimicry, in
          which the cuckoo egg resembles that of the host, thus minimizing
          rejection by the host; removal of one or more host eggs by the adult
          cuckoo, reducing both the competition from host nestlings and the
          danger of recognition by the host that an egg has been added to the
          nest; and nest-mate ejection, in which the young cuckoo heaves from
          the nest the hostâ€™s eggs and nestlings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some species of Cuculus resemble certain bird-eating hawks (Accipiter)
          in appearance and mannerisms, apparently frightening the potential
          host and allowing the cuckoo to approach the nest unmolested"
