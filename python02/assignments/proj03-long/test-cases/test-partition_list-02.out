Testing partition_list()...

Input list: 100 -> 50 -> 25 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1
Returned list 1: 100 -> 25 -> 10 -> 2
Returned list 2: 50 -> 20 -> 5 -> 1

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
Output list node check complete.
