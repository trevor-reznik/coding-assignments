Testing partition_list()...

Input list: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> 13 -> 17 -> 19 -> 23
Returned list 1: 2 -> 5 -> 11 -> 17 -> 23
Returned list 2: 3 -> 7 -> 13 -> 19

Checking to make sure that all of the nodes in the output list are
from the input list.  If you see a failure reported here, then
it's likely that you did one or more of the following:
   - Created new nodes, instead of just changing the references
   - Swapped values between nodes
 ... Checking ...
Output list node check complete.
